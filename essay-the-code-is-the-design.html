      <p>
	Once in a while  you would read an article that  resonates with your own
	experience and observation.  In the  case of Jack Reeves's article "What
	is Software  Design?", the resonation is  so strong that it sparked more
	pondering and wondering.
      </p>

      <p>
	The  main idea  of the  article is  that software  code is  the ultimate
	software  design;  hence, programming  activity  is  not about  building
	software,  but designing  it.   Compilers and  linkers  would build  the
	software  from  the   code  (i.e.   the  design),   which  costs  almost
	nothing. Software code is not the only design artefact but it's the most
	detailed one; like the blue print of a building where builder uses it to
	do construction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since building software  is almost free, once the design  has been coded
	in some programming language it makes  more sense to just build and test
	the software (then  if required, refine with more build  and test cycle)
	than  do to  anything else  (e.g.  formal  verification). Through  these
	cycles of  code, build and  test the programmer explores,  validates and
	refines his  design.  The  more seamless  this process  can be  the more
	productive the programmer would be.
      </p>      
      
      <p>
	Some  programming  languages  have  taken  a step  forward  on  this  by
	providing read-eval-print loop (REPL)  facility.  REPL is an interactive
	facility that  reads programmer's input  (code), evaluates it  and print
	result of the  evaluation. The benefit of  this is that it  cuts out the
	build step which  might take time and requires context  switching by the
	programmer (from  writing code to doing  build).  The cycle is  now more
	seamless and  smooth with just  code and test,  code and test,  code and
	test... 
      </p>

      <p>
	It is  worthwhile differentiating  two kinds of  testing here;  both are
	important but for different purpose. The first kind is the one mentioned
	above; testing  is part of  the code, build and  test cycle in  order to
	explore, validate and refine design.   It is performed by programmer and
	cannot be  automated.  The  second kind  is testing  to verify  that the
	software  functions as  expected;  this can  be  performed at  different
	levels, such as unit, integration, acceptance,  etc.  This is best to be
	automated so that it can be run often to detect regression issue.
      </p>

      <p>
	Software code as  design means that design is coded  in some programming
	language.   We have  come  a long  way in  this,  from cryptic  assembly
	language as design notation to function, object and logic languages. The
	key  factor here  is expressiveness,  simplicity and  integrity; a  good
	programming language  is able capture high-level  concepts and represent
	low-level  details in  a simple  and integral  way. Along  this line,  a
	language's  ability  to  form  domain specific  language  (DSL)  greatly
	improves  the design  as the  design  notations are  customized for  the
	specific application domain.
      </p>

      <p>
	Design  is an  important form  of documentation,  which in  this context
	means that software code is a  form of software documentation. It has an
	unique advantage over  other design documentation as it is  always up to
	date.   A disadvantage  of  code as  documentation  is its  textual-only
	nature. It would  be a step forward if tools  are available to transform
	textual   code   into   various   graphical   representations   of   the
	design.  This  is because  visualization is a  powerful tool  that human
	mind uses to conceptualize, reason and share with others.
