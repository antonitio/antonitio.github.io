      <p>
	The   tendency  of   software  development   to  focus   only  on   user
	functionalities  has  resulted in  software  that  are hard  to  change,
	maintain and operate.  Although software usage  by its users is the sole
	reason for its  existence, the ablility to change,  maintain and operate
	with ease  are equally important aspects  of the software; even  more so
	now  since we  are  living  in the  world  where  changes are  constant.
	Achieving good quality means balancing  between all these aspects of the
	software.
      </p>

      <p>
	One way  to achieve this is  by starting with viewing  software from the
	relevant perspectives.  At the very  least, for a particular software we
	need to consider two perspectives: user (someone that uses it to perform
	some functions) and developer (someone  needs to build and maintain it).
	In  addition to  those,  operator's perspective  might  be necessary  if
	operation  of the  software  requires additional  efforts  such as  high
	availability, continuous supervision, redundancy and backup, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
	Depending  on the  type and  purpose of  the software,  each perspective
	would identify  its own attributes  that are crucial in  contributing to
	the quality of the software.  For example, a mobile phone software would
	have slightly  different attributes compare  to a web-based  software; a
	banking  transaction software  would  require a  very  different set  of
	attributes than a photo editing software.
      </p>

      <p>
	At  the  center  of   <b>user's  perspective</b>  is  the  functionality
	attribute;  a  software  has  to  perform  all  its  intended  functions
	correctly.   It applies  to  software  of all  types  and purposes,  and
	consumes most of  the effort in software development.   Even though it's
	the most important, but it's not  the only attribute that contributes to
	quality  from  user's point  of  view;  exclusively  focus on  it  might
	compromise  overall   quality  of  the  software.   Attributes  such  as
	usability,  performance,  compatiblity  and security  are  other  common
	attributes  that might  be applicable  and  important for  users of  the
	particular software.  A useful way  to visualize the user perspective is
	a circle;  at the center of  the circle is the  functionality attribute,
	and spread across the rest of the space are other attributes, some might
	be closer to the center, e.g.  usability attribute; others maybe located
	near the perihery of the circle, e.g. compatibility attribute.
      </p>

      <p>
	Software   development  without   taking  into   account  <b>developer's
	perspective</b> would  tend to  produce software  that are  difficult to
	change and maintain.  Unlike hardware,  software are in contant pressure
	for  change because  it can  be changed  easily, needs  to adapt  to new
	usage, or  extend existing functions.   From developer's point  of view,
	software  attributes such  as  readability, reusability,  documentation,
	testability,  are  common attributes  that  contribute  to good  quality
	software.
      </p>

      <p>
	<b>Operator's perspective</b>  is necessary  if efficient  operation and
	usage of a  software require non-user effort. The kind  of software that
	falls into this category usually has a large number of users and employs
	some variation of client-server software architecture. A typical example
	of this is web-based software where  there are many concurrent users and
	user interactions  with the software  running on the server  are through
	web browser as  the client. In this case, the  operation of the software
	with  its own  attributes contributes  greatly to  the overall  software
	quality. Examples  of common attributes from  operator's perspective are
	availability, monitoring, redundancy, scalability, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
	Once  the software  has  been examined  from  relevant perspectives  and
	applicable attributes are  selected for each perspective,  the next step
	is to detail what are required for each attribute and how to verify what
	are  required  have  been  achieved.  For  examples,  for  functionality
	attribute, it's usually done by  specifying all the intended funtions in
	details and verify that those functions are performed correctly by doing
	functional testing (usually are performed at unit/component, integration
	and  user acceptance  level);  for readability  attribute,  it could  be
	achieved  by  providing  programming   guideline  and  standard  (naming
	convention, comment approach, etc) which  can be verified by peer review
	process.
      </p>

      <p>
	Good  quality  software  is  the result  of  software  development  that
	balances the  different aspects  of the  software. This  can be  done by
	examining  the   software  from   relevant  perspectives   to  determine
	applicable software  attributes, detail  what are  required for  each of
	them, and ensure that they are satisfied.
      </p>

	***  I use  the term  software  here to  refer to  software system  that
	consists of  multiple parts  or subsystems, and  needs to  interact with
	other software systems in order  to perform its functions.  A calculator
	software  that performs  mathematical calculations  would not  fall into
	this  category.  A  foreign  currency exchange  software  that  provides
	real-time exchange rates information for multiple currencies would be in
	this category as it needs to  store different currency data and interact
	with financial systems to get those exchange rates.
