      <p class="timestamp">Updated: 12 August 2014</p>

      <p>
	As software becomes an important part of our modern life, good
	quality software  is a necessity.  Achieving  good quality for
	any  non-trivial   software  requires  careful   planning  and
	execution.  I suggest  that there are three  aspects which are
	crucial to  achieve good  quality software; these  are quality
	assurance, quality attributes and quality control.  Let's call
	this Q3 approach.
      </p>

      <p>
	Quality => assurance + attribute + control
      </p>

      <p>  Software quality  assurance establishes  the processes  and
	standards that lead to good  quality software.  A software can
	be said to have such quality  if it satisfies all the required
	quality  attributes.  Software  quality  control verifies  and
	validates that those required attributes are achieved.
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
	<b>Quality assurance</b>
      </p>

      <p>
	At the minimum, quality  assurance should establish process to
	select and  define the  required quality  attributes, software
	engineering  process, measurement  and reporting  process, and
	setting of various standards and guidelines.
      </p>

      <p>
	Employing the  right software  engineering process  is crucial
	for assuring the  quality of a software.   For example, modern
	software that  needs to  evolve quickly with  changing demand,
	agile software development practices have proven to meet these
	challenges successfully.  Usually  to support these practices,
	certain  infrastructure and  tools  need to  be  set up,  e.g.
	continuous  integration server,  multi-stage  deploy and  test
	environments, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
	Most often the software  engineering process would specify how
	to measure and report quality  and progress; if not, some form
	of measurement and reporting  mechanisms need to be developed.
	Using  agile practices  as  example, progress  is measured  by
	stories completion or number of  backlog items, and quality by
	passing  of automated  tests  in different  testing forms  and
	stages.
      </p>

      <p>
	To assure quality, standards and  guidelines should be set for
	various software  artefacts and  documents, such as  design or
	requirement   format   standard,    coding   guideline,   test
	implmentation guideline, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
	Example of other processes that  are often defined in software
	quality assurance are education  and training of staff, change
	management, and error collection and analysis process.
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
	<b>Quality attributes</b>
      </p>

      <p>
	There are  many different  software quality  attributes; which
	attributes are  used usually depend  on the type  of software,
	e.g. web  application, mobile  application, etc.   For example
	web application software, commonly required quality attributes
	are  functionality,  usability, compatibility  (web  browser),
	maintainability,    security,    reliability,    availability,
	performance and scalability.
      </p>

      <p>
	Further  clarification need  to be  made on  the functionality
	attribute.  It represents all  the functional requirements, so
	in  order   to  satisfy   this  attribute  all   the  required
	functionalities  of  the  software must  be  achieved.   Since
	functionalities  are  why  the  the software  is  built,  this
	attribute is required across all different types of software.
      </p>

      <p>
	I do not think it is appropriate to lump all the other quality
	attributes as non-functional attributes because doing so would
	make  these   attributes  usually  being  perceived   as  less
	important.  Futhermore, each of  these attributes has each own
	characteristics and  has to be  verified and validated  in its
	own way.   For example  maintanability attribute, it  is about
	the static aspect of the  software where codes are structured,
	implemented  and  documented in  such  a  way to  ease  future
	changes if  necessary; it  cannot be tested  dynamically while
	running the software.
      </p>

      <p>
	Once selected and defined  as the required quality attributes,
	each attibute is as important as others in contributing to the
	overall quality of the software.
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
	<b>Quality control</b>
      </p>

      <p>
	Quality  control  encompasses  of   what  generally  known  as
	software  testing   and  software  review  with   emphasis  on
	verifying and  validating all the required  quality attributes
	in a balance manner.  Different quality attributes are treated
	differently;  some need  to  be  tested (e.g.   functionality,
	performance,    etc.),   others    need    to   be    reviewed
	(e.g. maintanability, integrity, etc.).
      </p>

      <p>
	Each quality  attribute that  is tested has  each own  type of
	testing,  such  as  functional testing,  performance  testing,
	security  testing, etc.   Some are  broken down  into diferent
	levels  like  unit,  system   and  acceptance  for  functional
	testing.  Also some are preferably to start testing after most
	of the  functional testing are completed,  such as performance
	testing.
      </p>

      <p>
	Some quality attributes, such  as modularity, cannot be tested
	directly but need to be reviewed.  Like testing, proper review
	process needs to be planned  and executed.  In terms of review
	methods, established software review  methods can be employed;
	such as technical review, walkthrough, and inspection.
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
	<b>*** Unconventional definition</b>
      </p>

      <p>
	In the software industry, most organizations intrepret quality
	assurance  to also  include quality  control (or  often called
	software testing).   However, I think clear  separation of the
	two  is necessary  as they  deal with  different concerns  and
	aspects in producing good quality software.  Quality assurance
	concerns on defining processes and standards that lead to good
	quality  (preventive  aspect);   whereas  quality  control  is
	concerned  with application  of these  processes, safeguarding
	and confirmation of achieving  the required quality (executive
	aspect).
