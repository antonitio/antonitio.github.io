	      It was the  best of times, it  was the worst of  times, it was
	      the age of  wisdom, it was the age of  foolishness, it was the
	      epoch of belief,  it was the epoch of incredulity,  it was the
	      season of  Light, it was  the season  of Darkness, it  was the
	      spring  of  hope,  it  was  the  winter  of  despair,  we  had
	      everything before  us, we had  nothing before us, we  were all
	      going direct  to Heaven,  we were all  going direct  the other
	      way...

	      Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br>
	      Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br>
	      Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,<br>
	      One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>
	      In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>
	      One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>
	      One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them,<br>
	      In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>

      <p class="say">
	      All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
	      Not all those who wander are lost;<br>
	      The old that is strong does not wither,<br>
	      Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br>
	      From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
	      A light from the shadows shall spring;<br>
	      Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
	      The crownless again shall be king.<br>

      <p class="say">
	Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
	Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows<br>
	Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>

	Be not afraid of greatness:<br>
	some are born great,<br>
	some achieve greatness,<br>
	and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.<br>

      <p class="say">
	All the world's a stage,<br>
	And all the men and women merely players;<br>
	They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
	And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
	His acts being seven ages.<br>
