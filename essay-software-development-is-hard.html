      <p>
	By  its nature,  software is  conceptual entity.   It mostly  deals with
	abstraction  of   real-world  representations  and   processes.  Banking
	software handles  the representation  of money in  the bank  account and
	various  processes   that  revolve   around  it   (deposit,  withdrawal,
	etc). Music playing software takes care of music representation (format,
	quality, etc) and different ways  of playing the music.  The abstraction
	manifests itself in data structures, relationships and algorithms in the
	form  of  computer  executable  codes using  a  variety  of  programming
	languages.
      </p>

      <p>
	This  conceptual nature  of software  and its  inherent properties  make
	software development hard.   Frederick Brooks in his  classic paper, "No
	Silver  Bullet   -  Essence  and  Accident   in  Software  Engineering",
	identifies   four   of   these   properties:   complexity,   comformity,
	changeability and invisibility.
      </p>

      <p>
	Like hardware,  software consists of  large number of parts;  but unlike
	hardware, most parts in software  are unique.  Moreover, these parts can
	interact with  each other in multiple  ways.  Combination of this  and a
	large   number  of   states   that  the   software   can  have   results
	in <b>complexity</b>.   Hence, reasoning is harder;  description is more
	tedious; modification is less reliable.
      </p>

      <p>
	Software rarely  operates alone; it  has to work together  with existing
	software and  hardware; to do  so its interfaces must  conform.  Because
	these interfaces  are designed by different  people, <b>conformation</b>
	differs  between  interfaces,  and  change  from  time  to  time.  Often
	arbitrarily, not out of necessity.
      </p>

      <p>
	Due to its  nature, software is ever malleable.  <b>Changes</b> are easy
	to make and  pressure to change is  ever present. This is  because as it
	becomes useful, more people would use it  and try out new use cases; its
	functions would  need to  be modified or  extended. Furthermore,  as its
	operating environment evolves (hardware and software), it must change to
	conform in  order to stay  functional.  Or  its business use  cases have
	shifted, it has to change to remain competitive or become innovative.
      </p>

      <p>
	Software is  <b>invisible</b>; no physical representation  in space that
	eyes  can see  or hands  can  touch. With  its many  parts and  possible
	states,  it's inherently  hard to  visualize flow  of data  and control,
	timing  of   activity  sequence,  relationship,  and   hierarchy.   This
	difficulty to  visualize, strip  out of  the mind  its powerful  tool to
	conceptualize, reason, and share with others effectively.
      </p>

      <p>
	Apart from  the nature of  software itself, another  contributing factor
	that makes software development hard is  that it is mostly a <b>creative
	and collaborative</b> process. Follow on  from the observation that code
	is  design, most  of  the  time in  software  development  are spent  in
	software  design.   Apart  from  technical  knowledge,  design  activity
	requires  creative thinking.   But  putting on  delivery  deadline on  a
	creative process usually does not  work very well. Most complex software
	are  produced  by a  team  of  developers. Organising  such  intelletual
	collaborative  effort presents  its  own  challenges (psychological  and
	technical).
