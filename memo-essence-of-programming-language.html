      <p>
	Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, by Harold Abelson and
	Gerald  Jay Sussman,  has  profoundly stated  that  the following  three
	mechanisms are the essence of powerful programming language:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  primitive  elements,  which represent  the  simplest  elements in  the
	  language
	</li>
	<li>
	  means  of  combination, by  which  compound  elements are  built  from
	  simpler ones
	</li>
	<li>
	  means  of abstraction,  by which  compound elements  can be  named and
	  manipulated as units
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Lisp  (and  its  decendents)  has  realised  this  kind  of  power  with
	simplicity and integrity  by using only few primitive  elements; list as
	the  mean  of combination;  and  first-class  function  as the  mean  of
	abstraction.
