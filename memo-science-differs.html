      <p class="title">Science Differs</p>

      <p>
	Yuval  Harari in  his  book, Sapiens:  A brief  history  of human  kind,
	critically points out three ways  in which science differs from previous
	human knowledge traditions:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  The  willingness  to  admit  ignorance.   It  assumes  we  don't  know
	  everything, and accepts  that the things which we think  we know could
	  be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The  centrality  of  observation   and  mathematics.   With  admitting
	  ignorance, it aims  to obtain new knowledge  by gathering observations
	  and  using  mathematical  tools  to connect  them  into  comprehensive
	  theories.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The acquisition of  new powers.  It applies these  theories to acquire
	  new power, particularly to develop new technologies.
	</li>
      </ul>
