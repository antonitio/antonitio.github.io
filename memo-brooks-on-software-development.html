      <p class="title">Brooks on Software Development</p>

      <p>
	Frederick Brooks in  his classic paper, "No Silver Bullet  - Essence and
	Accident  in Software  Engineering" -  though pessimistic  in title  but
	realistic in content - has  answered two prominent questions in software
	development.
      </p>

      <p>
	Why software development is hard?
      </p>

      <p>
	It is  due to the nature  of software itself.  Brooks  has duly observed
	that there  are four  essential software  properties that  contribute to
	this: complexity, conformity, changeability, and invinsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
	What can we do about it?
      </p>

      <p>
	Brooks  has nailed  it down  by suggesting  two keywords:  prototype and
	organic.   To  develop the  right  software,  use rapid  prototyping  to
	establish requirements.   To develop  the software right,  grow software
	organically by  adding more and more  functions as they are  run, tested
	and used.
