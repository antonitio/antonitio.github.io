	<span class="actor">Brutus:</span><br>
	Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;<br>
	Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,<br>
	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;<br>
	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,<br>
	Stir up their servants to an act of rage,<br>
	And after seem to chide 'em.<br>

	Julius Caesar Act 2, Scene 1
      </p><br>

      <p class="say">
	<span class="actor">Wolsey:</span><br>
	So farewell-to the little good you bear me.<br>
	Farewell? a long farewell to all my greatness!<br>
	This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth<br>
	The tender leaves of hopes, to-morrow blossoms,<br>
	And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;<br>
	The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,<br>
	And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely<br>
	His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,<br>
	And then he falls as I do.<br>

      <p class="say">
	<span class="actor">Chorus:</span><br>
	Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
	Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows<br>
	Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>

	My liege, and madam, to expostulate<br>
	What majesty should be, what duty is,<br>
	What day is day, night night, and time is time,<br>

	To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
	And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,<br>
	No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
	The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
	That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation<br>
	Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
	To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:<br>
	For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br>
	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
	Must give us pause—there's the respect<br>
	That makes calamity of so long life.<br>
